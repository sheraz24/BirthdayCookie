# BirthdayCookie

This is a quick little p5.js game that gives the user the chance to eat a cookie virtually by clicking on a button. Once the cookie is finished, the user can choose to eat another. Each new cookie is created with a random assortment of chocolate chips on the surface - each cookie is unique!

This game can be embedded in a website for example. 

See here for the functioning game
